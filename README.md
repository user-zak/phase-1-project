# Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. The goal of this analysis is to explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create. For this analysis, we will focus on the following questions:

1. What genre of movies are doing good in the market right now?
2. How does the runtime of a movie influence its success?
3. Which genre of movies do good in which regions?
4. What is the best time of year to launch a movie?



## ## Business Understanding

Microsoft wants to join in on the fun of creating original video content. They created a movie studio but don't know where to start. Therefore, they have tasked us with deriving meaningful insights from movie data to help them make informed business decisions and break into the video content industry.

The goal is to analyze the data and provide answers to the following questions:

1. What genre of movies is currently performing well in the market?
2. How does the runtime of a movie influence its success?
3. Which genres of movies perform well in different regions?
4. What is the best time of year to launch a movie?

## Project Overview

This project aims to assist Microsoft's new movie studio in making data-driven decisions for their entry into the video content industry. By performing exploratory data analysis and deriving insights from movie data, the project seeks to provide recommendations on genre selection, runtime optimization, regional preferences, and optimal release time. These insights will guide Microsoft in focusing their resources effectively, attracting a wider audience, and maximizing revenue potential.

## Insights

Based on the analysis of the movie data, the following insights have been derived:

### 1. Genre Focus

To gain traction in the industry, Microsoft should focus on genres that bring in the highest revenue. Genres like Animation, Adventure, and Sci-Fi have shown promising performance in terms of revenue generation.
